## To run basic

I included a build JS file so just double click index.html to open in Crome.

## To run fancy or for dev

Install Node: ```apt-get install node-js```

Install dependencies from base directory: ```npm install```

Build js: ```npm run-script build```

Run for dev: ```webpack-dev-server -- inline```

## Notes

Use Chrome. Minor visual bug in lesser browsers.
